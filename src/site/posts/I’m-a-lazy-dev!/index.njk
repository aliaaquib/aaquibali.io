Yes I’m a lazy dev! I am a lazy dev. I admit it. I don’t like to write code that is repetitive, boring, or unnecessary. I prefer to automate, reuse, or optimize my tasks as much as possible. I believe that being lazy is not a bad thing, but a sign of intelligence and creativity.

Some people may think that being a lazy dev means being unproductive, irresponsible, or sloppy. They may accuse me of cutting corners, skipping tests, or ignoring standards. They may say that I don’t care about quality, performance, or security. They may assume that I don’t have passion, motivation, or ambition.

Being a lazy dev means that I use the best tools and practices available to me. It means that I leverage the power of existing libraries, frameworks, and platforms to avoid reinventing the wheel. It means that I follow the principles of DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It) to write clean, concise, and maintainable code. It means that I apply the concepts of refactoring, testing, and debugging to ensure the quality and reliability of my code.

Being a lazy dev means that I embrace the challenges and opportunities of new technologies and trends. It means that I learn from the best sources and experts in the field, and I keep myself updated with the latest developments and innovations. It means that I experiment with different ideas and solutions, and I try to find the best fit for my needs and goals. It means that I share my knowledge and experience with others, and I contribute to the community.

Being a lazy dev is not something to be ashamed of. It is something to be proud of. It is a mindset that drives me to do more with less, to do better with less, and to do smarter with less. It is a philosophy that guides me to achieve excellence in my work. I am a lazy dev. And you should be one too.
