}</style><p>Programming is an art that cannot be learned in a year or so. You need to practice it continuously and regularly to be pro at it. But, before becoming a pro, some basic fundamentals and foundations are important. This guide will tell you about some of the efficient practices to use while programming.</p><p>Sounds exciting? Let’s get right into it!</p><p><b>1. What is programming?</b></p><p>I won’t spend too much time here since if you’re reading this, you likely have a pretty solid idea of what programming and coding is.</p><p>It’s just a formalized version of the logic, in the vocabulary and syntax of the language that a machine can interpret. “I want to see all the rows in this database table” becomes SELECT * FROM table. It’s the implementation level of tech. So, to get better at programming, you’ll be writing a lot of code!</p><p><b>2. Why to learn Programming?</b></p><p>If you came up with the answer simply by reading this section’s headline, that’s a really good sign. One of the biggest factors why people don’t follow through on learning any skill is because their “why” is either non-existent or ambiguous.</p><p>Know what’s your why. Major ideas for learning programming are: Get a better job, be happy, have an impact, become financially secure, discover new hobbies or passions, etc. Whatever you come up with, drill down on the details. Remember, the clearer your answer, the higher your motivation will be for learning programming or any other skill.</p><p><b>3. How to practice Programming?</b></p><p>Some skills can have a higher ratio of knowledge v/s application. This is NOT the case with programming. Programming is one of the skills where you need to practice a lot more than to focus on the theory.</p><p>I will recommend you to spend at least 80% of your time writing code and 20% learning the theory. As you learn more and more, I’d suggest increasing the practice ratio. In short, <b>every minute you spend trying to understand the concepts, you should spend about 5x more time on putting it into practice.</b> That’s how the concepts will sink into your brain and start making sense; not by re-reading it multiple times.</p><p><b>Remember: </b>It’s not just about typing out code. It’s also about fixing bugs, maintenance, security, testing, user experience, architecture, systems, databases, and all sorts of other things. It gets complicated. Learning to code is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>It’s not an easy ride, to begin with, programming, especially if you haven’t had much practice with other logical skills in the past. That’s why being good at math is often a requirement to get into a computer programming program. The math you’ll use in programming is rarely that complex, but the logic you learned by applying math greatly accelerates your programming abilities.</p><p><b>4. How to break the sessions?</b> This greatly depends on your situation. Some of you will be able to do proficient enough with a full month of practice others can’t dedicate much time at all. For most skills, I recommend practicing for at least 15 minutes per day. But for programming, that’s not enough. For programming, if you practice for 30 minutes every day, that’s 3.5 hours per week or 14 hours per month.</p><p>While everything is fresh in your mind, things will seem easy, but if you stop practicing for even just a month, you’ll lose around 60 percent of what you previously learned. The golden rule is spaced learning and repetition. And you should recall what you learned regularly enough.</p><p><b>5. When to practice Programming?</b></p><p>Just one-word answer <b>— “Every day”</b></p><p>The more you can make your skill practice a habit, the easier it will be to follow through and get results. It’s always more motivating to focus for 30 minutes, for example, than to focus on writing a complex piece of code. But since programming is a complex skill, make sure to practice when your mind is sharpest.</p><p>While most programmers proclaim to be night owls, research shows that most people have their minds sharpest shortly after waking up. If you’re unsure when’s the right time for you, I’d start with the early morning. If it doesn’t work right away, please don’t give up just try a different time. New habits take time to form.</p><p>Practice using different languages, frameworks and IDEs. Try pair programming. Do functional programming, OOP, component-based programming. Try scripting or ML. Code in your room, kitchen, at cafes, school, outside, etc. Try with different types of music. There’s an infinite combination of things you can do!</p><p><b>6. Basic concepts of Programming</b></p><p>Truth be told, the skill of programming is too broad. If you want to learn “programming”, you’ll lose motivation quickly. It’s overwhelming beyond imagination to view it as a single entity! As such, we’ll break it apart into the following sub-skills:</p><p><b>7. Good programming practices</b></p><p>The basics above help you get started, but you won’t be a very good programmer yet with those. Below, I’ll explain some ways to go from noob to good in a short while. This section is the most complex one, so if you can’t follow along currently, don’t forget to bookmark to revisit it later when your mind is sharpest!</p><p><b>8. Getting stuck</b><br>Being stuck somewhere is a skill in itself because without committing any error, you won’t learn it. As you keep learning, you’ll frequently come across stackoverflow.com or similar websites. When you Google how to do something in programming, chances are someone else had the same issue as you did and someone else gave a clear answer and how to fix it.</p><p>There’s no shame in not knowing every answer. There’s simply too much to programming to know everything. In the programming world, you’re always expected to be resourceful and figure out answers by yourself first — which is a great way to learn anything. If you can’t figure it out after trying, then is the time to seek out help from others, either in person or by asking on Stack Overflow.</p><p><b>9. Final Tips</b></p><p>Compare different codes. Try to understand which one is more efficient in terms of complexity, readability, and generalization. Nothing is final. Always, try to make a more efficient code than your earlier version. Don’t just learn to code, learn how to become a developer. Learn to tackle the bugs.</p><hr><p>* <b>Relax.</b> It’s not a race, there’s no rush. You’re not <i>“falling behind” </i>anyone else by not knowing things if you’ve only just started. You wouldn’t write a novel when you’ve only just finished learning the alphabet. So, <b>just enjoy it.</b></p></div></article><aside class="sharing">Did you enjoy the article?
